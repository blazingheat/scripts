Troubleshoot:

If you still have issues, check /var/log/cassandra/debug.log for errors

The most common is if you start the cassandra server prior to the configuration being set up, you'll have to delete the /var/lib/cassandra directory.

Then after this, you'll have to recreate this directory with "sudo mkdir /var/lib/cassandra"

After re-creating, you'll have to do "sudo chmod a+rwx /var/lib/cassandra" (or basically just only give it to the user "cassandra")
